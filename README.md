# Explorative-Analysis-on-Legal-Cases
In order to better apply artificial intelligence to legal proceedings, it is necessary to systematically analyze and understand legal cases related to climate change.
The data is downloaded from westlaw.

### K-Means
In our clustering analysis, we implemented Word2vec and obtained average word embeddings for document level, efficiently representing document into vectorized space. 
Due to the result, we noticed forest, land, water and air emissions are primary topics discussed in the dataset. 
Instead of climate topics we extracted, we also found out there are government office, agency actively involved in these cases, aiming at protecting environment. 

### LDA/ LDA MALLET
We import the LDAMallet model to try if we could develop the coherence score in order to â€œachieve the highest correlation with all available human topic ranking data.
